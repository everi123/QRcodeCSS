## My process

### Built with

- non Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

#### skill that i gained while practicing on this challenge:
 
 - how to center a div using flexbox layout
 - difference between semantics and non-semantic structure properties
 - usage of different type of unit(rem,vh,px)
 - how to direct your thought to design mobile-first and advantages that the      latter facilitates.

### my favourite part of code


```css
.container{
  display:flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction:column;
  padding:1rem;
  max-width:18rem;
  min-width:8rem;
  margin:20vh auto;
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  
  background-color:hsl(0,0%,100%);
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-radius:1.3rem;
  
  
}
```

### Continued development
 i would like to repeat the same challenge using simply grid layout and olso add a little bit of animation,
 why not building a template card.
